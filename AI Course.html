                explanation: 'A large language model is a giant neural network trained on vast amounts of information (like books, articles, code from the internet). It uses **statistics and probabilities** to **predict** the next most likely **word or text** sequence based on all the previous text it has been **trained on**, essentially generating new information rather than truly understanding or being intelligent. It finds **patterns** in the data.'

All student activity is **monitorable by a teacher**, and a second AI can **monitor** for unproductive, unhealthy behavior, or cheating, actively **notifying** the teacher or parents. Crucially, it\'s built to **not do the work for the student** but rather to work *with* them, acting as a writing coach or tutor, enabling brainstorming and feedback rather than direct answers.'

                explanation: '**AI fiction** (also called hallucination) refers to instances where AI systems confidently produce **text that sounds very real but is actually not true** or **made up**. This is a concern because large language models are designed to **mimic human language**, not to be 100% factual, meaning they are **language models, not knowledge models**. This can lead to the **spread of false information** much **faster** and in **larger amounts** than before, making it difficult for users (especially students) to differentiate between factual information and AI-generated content.'

                explanation: '**Algorithmic bias** is when AI systems produce **unfair or discriminatory results**, often due to biases in the **data they\'re trained on** or their **algorithm design**. It represents consistent errors favoring one group over another. An example from the sources is **facial recognition systems** performing poorly on the faces of people of color, leading to wrongful accusations. Another example is ChatGPT exhibiting a **left-leaning bias** or AI detection programs being more likely to flag writing from **non-native English speakers** as AI-generated.'

                explanation: 'The **biggest risk** for educators is **doing nothing**, meaning continuing to **teach everything the exact same way** or trying to **prevent AI from being used** in classrooms. This approach risks **leaving students behind** and failing to **prepare them for the future of education and work**, as AI is a game-changing tool that will transform education regardless.'

                explanation: 'Two key principles for students when interacting with AI are: 1. **AI can fabricate**: Any output may be made up, mistaken, or subtly wrong, so students should be responsible for their own work and **check sources** with credible information. 2. **AI is not a person**: It\'s easy to imbue AI with a personality, but it doesn\'t know the student or their context. Students should also understand they are **in charge** of the conversation and can direct it.

                explanation: 'Teachers should consider: 1. Whether the tool was **designed to be used in an educational setting**. 2. If the teacher has **visibility into how students are interacting** with the tool. 3. What **guard rails** are in place to ensure **student safety** (e.g., student privacy, preventing misinformation, bias, or dangerous content). This includes checking for compliance with regulations like **FERPA and COPPA**. It\'s also advised to scan the **privacy policy** for school use, age restrictions, and data practices, look for **first-party help articles**, and even **stress test** the tool yourself.'
